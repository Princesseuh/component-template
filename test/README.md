# `test` directory

This folder contain tests for your component(s). This templates makes no assumption regarding your way of writting code. You can either write the code first and then the tests or the reverse (known as Test-Driven Development). Ultimately, what's important is that your code works and is tested to prove it!

A commented example test (see `example.test.js`) is included in this folder to help you learn how to write a basic test for your project
